# WindowsProgramQueue
A utility for queuing execution of programs

I tried looking for something that would let me queue up multiple 7-zip runs, and found nothing. 7-zip didn't have anything built in, and I didn't find anyone talking about anything someone could use in order to achieve that goal.

So, I created this simple tool to solve this problem for 7-zip and any other program that you might want to queue.

This utility gives you the ability to queue up multiple programs one after the other and have them run sequentially. It also provides the ability to run multiple programs from the queue at once, if you need to.
